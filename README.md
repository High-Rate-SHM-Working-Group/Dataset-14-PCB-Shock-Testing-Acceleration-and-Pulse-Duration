# Dataset 14-PCB Shock Testing Acceleration and Pulse Duration
This dataset contains repeated drop-test shock data for a fixed-fixed printed circuit board (PCB), with controlled variation in peak acceleration magnitude and pulse duration. For each test condition, the number of impacts to electrical failure is recorded to characterize PCB shock survivability.

DISTRIBUTION STATEMENT A. Approved for public release; distribution unlimited. AFRL-2026-0036

The experimental data contained in this repository are described in "Roberts et al., Adaptive Shock Testing and Failure Prediction of Printed Circuit Boards Using Kriging-Based Experimental Design", presented at the 2026 SPIE Smart Structures and Nondestructive Evaluation Conference.
